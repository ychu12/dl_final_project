# TODO:

1. Convert image data to pixel data, and put that in a csv file. The labels are basically "has_cancer", which can be true or false represented by a 1 or a 0. I'm assuming that if there are annotations for an image, then that image has cancer.

2. Do something like an 80/20 split on the csv file for training and testing. Then, use that in the model and test different architectures

3. Get the visualization code to work.
